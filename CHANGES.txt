- Require to pass in a ``secret`` parameter to configure middleware
  security. [malthe]

0.5 (released 2008-10-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rewritten URLs are now signed by the middleware to ensure that
  bitblt requests are only crafted by the middleware. This is required
  to shield against DoS attacks. [malthe]

0.4 (released 2008-10-11)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fixed path handling. [malthe]

- Added HTML document processing which scans document for image tags
  and rewrite image ``src`` attribute to include "bitblt" traversing
  directive. This makes it work as an actual middleware, since the
  application semantics are then unchanged. [malthe]

- No longer accept query parameters, but instead require traversing
  directive "/bitblt-<width>x<height>". [malthe]

- Removed functionality to MIME-type convert. [malthe]

0.3 (released 2008-10-10)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Made logic robust to unexpected parameters. [malthe]

- Fixed bug where parameters would be drawn from the WSGI environment. [malthe]
